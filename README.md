# Introduction
Hi! I'm Muhammad Abdullah Talukder, a student in the Software Maintenance
and Evolution course.
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance
practices and how to work with legacy systems.
- **Fun fact**: I code better when i am sleep deprived.
- **Course expectations**: I expect to learn the principles and practices essential for maintaining and evolving software systems. One of my primary goals is to understand techniques for code refactoring, which will allow me to improve existing code without altering its external behavior. Additionally, I expect to master version control tools and strategies, as they are crucial for managing changes to software projects over time..
